##I was tasked, as part of my digital-marketing internship, with designing a comprehensive 30-day social-media content calendar for a premium coffee-shop brand, specifically to introduce and promote its new Hazelnut Cold Brew line on Instagram. The deliverable—submitted as a styled Excel spreadsheet—sets out daily posts that mix product highlights, educational snippets, engagement prompts, customer testimonials, staff spotlights, and limited-time offers, all written in a professional, elegant tone consistent with the brand’s voice. Each entry includes a polished caption, a carefully curated set of visibility-boosting hashtags, and a creative image or visual concept, ensuring both aesthetic cohesion and strategic variety. The project demonstrates my ability to blend social-media strategy, copywriting, and campaign scheduling into a practical, ready-to-publish plan that balances brand storytelling with conversion-driven goals.
